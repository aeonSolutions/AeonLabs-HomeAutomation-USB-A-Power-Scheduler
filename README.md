# USB-A Power Scheduler

This is a simple Power Scheduler with BLE / WIFI connectivity to turn ON or OFF a USB-A port/Plug/outlet at any given day and hour. Compatible with all major commercial vendors and also open source vendors such as Home Assistant. The innovation of this  USB Power Scheduler device is in the ability to schedule charging to specific times during the day and night according to the price of electricity change. It can be programmed using machine learning to connect to an electricity market data source and calculate the best time to schedule power according to the price variations in the electricity markets.

**revision 05-2024** <br>
In this most recent revision, I'm using the microcontroller¬†ESP32¬†C3 and an extreme low power management system that makes this device consume a mere ~360nA when connected to a USB plug and¬†in¬†standby¬†mode.
It also features USB-A to Serial UART connectivity on the USB-A¬†male¬†connector for firmware upgrades & updates, and it can also be used to probe a USB Power Delivery¬†Network. More of these Smart Scheduler Devices connected to your home "USB Power Delivery Network", that Network will be more secure and safe from hacks and intrusion.

Plus.... <br>
scheduling of charging a device for an hour more convenient, when the electricity price is lower, for instance during late-night hours.


Made to fit a cheap plastic enclosure sold on AliExpress. See the parts list below for more information.

## OEM Firmware code
The OEM version of the firmware code can be found in the folder **firmware code**.  It has by default OTA updates, meaning this smart switch device automatically updates itself when newer updated versions are made available here.  
This code uses my own ESP32 C++ class libraries to expedite the development of code for ESP32 microcontrollers. The repository is located [here](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/aeonlabs-ESP32-C-Base-Firmware-Libraries#readme) for anyone to use.

### Home App for Android‚Ñ¢
HomeApp is a small and easy to use smart home app with a simple framework. The goal of this application is to make remote execution of predefined features as easy and user-friendly as possible to help you get started with smart home technology.
